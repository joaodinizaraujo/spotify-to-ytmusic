## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes  

1. **Personal Project**:  
   This repository was developed for learning and personal use. The code may include specific solutions tailored to my needs and has not been broadly tested for general use.  

2. **Limitations**:  
   - Relies on the accuracy of Spotify and YouTube Music Unofficial APIs.  
   - Errors may occur with songs having similar names or available in different versions.  

3. **API Usage**:  
   - You must create and configure authentication tokens for both platforms.  
   - Users are responsible for adhering to API usage limits and policies set by these platforms.
